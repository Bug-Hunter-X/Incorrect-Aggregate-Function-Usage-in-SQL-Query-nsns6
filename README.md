This repository demonstrates a common SQL error: the incorrect use of aggregate functions without a `GROUP BY` clause.  The `bug.sql` file contains a query that attempts to count the total number of orders while also selecting the `customer_id` without grouping. This leads to unexpected and inaccurate results. The `solution.sql` file provides a corrected version of the query. This example highlights the importance of understanding how aggregate functions interact with `GROUP BY` to produce accurate results in SQL queries.
